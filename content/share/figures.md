share_title: Sen. Wortham Praises DHQS Smuggling Operation Bust
share_body: In a press conference on Thursday Sen. Wortham (R-Mass.) praised the
  DHQS on the successful execution of their anti-smuggling operation colloqually
  known as "Operation Road Runner". All in all the operation seized 16 tons of
  illegal goods that were being smuggled in from the Loss. DHQS operatives were
  also responsible for the apprehension of nearly 150 homo sacer attempting
  immigration, and the capture of 17 so-called coyotes attempting to help them
  enter the country through illicit means.
